# Tangerine Pacman PVP

A web3 PVP & MVM Pacman game where players pay .0001 eth or the equivalent value in $-TRAP, 1 on 1 winner takes all. Compete against each other for cryptocurrency rewards on the Base network. 

## About üçäTRAP Token

üçäTRAP was conceived by @replyfan & @clanker released on the Base network during the Solana $Trump hype. The day Trump gave his Sol, Trump green lights the Solana based token, immediately his wife $Melania and extended family become jealous and start launching shitcoins.. The game integrates the üçä Trap token as one of the payment options, reminding players to:

- Pay entry fees using üçäTRAP tokens
- Win üçäTRAP tokens by defeating opponents
- Support an anti meme coin on the Base network

**Token Contract Address**: `0x300Ba4799Ab7d6fd55b87BCcBCeCb772b413349b`

## Dynamic Pricing

The game uses Uniswap oracle pricing to ensure that players pay the same value whether using ETH or üçäTRAP tokens:

- ETH entry fee is fixed at 0.0001 ETH
